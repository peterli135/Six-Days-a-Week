# Six Days a Week
 
(note: this project is a work in progress and currently in development; working on it when during my free time)
 A website that allows you to log all your workouts so you don't lose track of your gym progress.
- Built with ReactJS, Golang, and MongoDB

## Current Website Functionality

- create an account and login to save your data and keep track of your progress
- add exercises and create workouts with the exercises for the dates that you did them on (e.g push day, pull day, etc.)
- view and keep track of your workouts by categorized months or view all your created workouts

## Demo

## Plans for future development

- create a calendar view where users can view their created workouts on the calendar
- create a progress page where users can view their strength progress for different exercises on a graph
- add mobile compatibility on phone browsers so users are able to log their exercises into their workouts when they are at the gym
- have a predefined set of common exercises in a database that users are able to choose from; users can add exercise if not there
- hosting the website eventually once the product has more functionality and is more refined/polished
